## synbak - Universal Backup System
Author: Ugo Viti <ugo.viti@initzero.it>

## What is synbak?
synbak is an application designed to unify several backup methods. synbak provides a powerful reporting system and a very simple interface for configuration files.
synbak is a wrapper for several existing backup programs suppling the end user with common method for configuration that will manage the execution logic for every single backup and will give detailed reports of backups result.

### synbak can make backups using:
- RSync over ssh, rsync daemon, smb and cifs protocols (using internal automount functions)
- Tar archives (tar, tar.gz and tar.bz2)
- Tape devices (using multi loader changer tapes too)
- LDAP databases
- MySQL databases
- Oracle databases
- PostgreSQL databases
- CD-RW/DVD-RW
- Wget to mirror HTTP/FTP servers

### synbak can make reports using:
- EMail
- HTML pages
- RSS feeds

Moreover, if you are a developer and want to contribute, the modular nature of synbak will allow you to easly write new backup methods, reports, and translations.

Please read the [FAQ](FAQ.md) to discover many useful tips.


## Features
### Architecture
#### Miscellaneous Features

* fully localized using the standard GNU gettext framework

### Backup Methods
#### Rsync

#### Tar
* backup of local files into flat tar archives
* optional support for bzip2 compression
* optional support for gzip compression
* optional support for archive verify

#### MySQL
* dumps of local or remote MySQL database servers
* on the fly bzip2 compression for sql dumps
* remote databases backup into single SQL bzip2 compressed dump file
* remote databases backup splitted into multiple SQL bzip2 compressed dump files (one for each database)
* database inclusion pattern
* database exclusion pattern 

#### PostgreSQL
* dumps of local or remote PostgreSQL database servers
* on the fly bzip2 compression for sql dumps
* remote databases backup into single SQL bzip2 compressed dump file
* remote databases backup splitted into multiple SQL bzip2 compressed dump files (one for each database)

#### Tape
* backup to tape archives (ex. DAT, DLT, etc...)
* multi loader support (device changer/loader)
* volume tag (BARCODE) reporting
* eject of tape at backup end
* tape backup verify 

#### LaserDisc
* backup to miscellaneous laser compact disks
* CD-RW
* DVD-RW/RAM
* eject of device at backup end 

#### Wget
* can make full automated mirrors of remote HTTP or FTP servers
* can download single file or a list of files from remote HTTP or FTP servers


### Report Methods
#### HTML
* a very friendly gui wil provide all infos that an administrator or an end user need 
* detailed reports view
* detailed calendar view for each year

#### RSS
* with the emerging RSS (Really Simple Syndication) protocol usage, you will find this report facility very useful, use it with your RSS aggregator 
* integration with enterprise network monitors like nagios and icinga

#### EMail
* receive via email the backup reports, the subject will describe if your backup gone well or not
